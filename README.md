# odin-recipes
In this project, our objective is to apply our knowledge of HTML by creating a straightforward yet engaging recipe website as part of The Odin Project Course. Our particular focus centers around the delightful world of fika recipes.

Throughout the development, we have incorporated essential HTML elements, including paragraphs, headings, both ordered and unordered lists, images, and links. This practical exercise not only reinforces our understanding of HTML but also allows us to create a functional and basic (not styled) recipe platform.

Furthermore, the project provides an opportunity to master the Git workflow, enabling us to make appropriate commits and effectively manage the version control of our work. This dual focus on both HTML proficiency and version control practices enhances our overall skill set as web developers.
